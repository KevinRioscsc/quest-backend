# Backend for my Web App called Quest
The backend uses express js and knex to do javascript quieries for my postgres database.

## Database
The database for this project is hosted on heroku using their postgres psql extension. I decided to use heroku becuase of that extension it makes usng quieres and using the command lines more easier because it's very similar to psql commands
